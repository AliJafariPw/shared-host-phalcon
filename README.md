# Phalcon on shared hosting:
Phalcon as a php library which make phalcon run on shared host

This project is about an idea for using phalcon php framework without phalcon installed on server and ssh access.
All zephir files have to convert to php files and make them as a library to include to your project.

# Converted files:
the convert.php file works base on [Zephir Parser](https://github.com/phalcon/php-zephir-parser) project.
this file parse *.zep files and make a php files base on them. The only thing remain is methods bodies which I need help you in.
